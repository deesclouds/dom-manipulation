# DOM Manipulation: Landing Project

This project uses DOM manipulation & JS methods to create the navigation menu dynamically based on the sections from the HTML file. 

An event listener is then added to the links within the menus to scroll smoothly to the sections linked to it. 

Uses a function and loops through the section elements adding an active state to the section currently visible within the viewport.

Uses the getBoundingClientRect() method to check if a section is in the viewport.

Then uses the scrollIntoView() method to smoothly scroll to the section clicked from the corresponding nav link within the navigation menu.
